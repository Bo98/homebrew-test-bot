# Homebrew Test Bot

Tests the full lifecycle of a Homebrew change.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap homebrew/test-bot
```

## CI Providers

`test-bot` only supports GitHub Actions as a CI provider. This is because Homebrew uses GitHub Actions and it's freely available for public and private use with macOS and Linux workers.
